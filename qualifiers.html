These solutions may have mistakes, typos, or even incorrect solutions. 
Send me an email if you happen to find any such mistakes. 
Some the solutions were originally from Yanbo Li and recently, I have worked worth Eric Tovar to clean up and correct these solutions (as of Aug 5th, 2020).
Still, some of the exam solutions are incomplete or have mistakes; some day I will eventually correct this issue.

I personally used the textbook "Numerical Treatment of Partial
Differential Equations" by Grossmann, Roos, and Stynes to help solve the 
problems.
