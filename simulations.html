<h3>Two Tanks Problem</h3>
In this problem, we solve a Riemann-like problem where two square domains are connected by a small tube. 
The initial states begin at rest with high pressure and density in the left tank. 
The material passes through the tube and into the right tank.
We show a comparison between the van der Waals and ideal equations of state.
Simulation details are given below.

<p><b>Geometry:</b> \( \{(-3,-1) \times (-1,1)\} \cup \{(-1,1)\times (-0.1,0.1) \} \cup \{(1,3)\times (-1,1)\} \)</p>
<p><b>Boundary Conditions:</b> The slip boundary condition (\(\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} = 0 \)) is enforced on all sides.
<p><b>Discretization:</b> The mesh was composed of uniform quadrilaterals (squares in this case) with 863,297 DoFs.</p>
<p> Final time: \(t = 50\). CFL = 0.9</p>
<p><b>Initial State:</b> \( (\rho_L, v_L, p_L) = (0.7, 0, 0.6) \) and \( (\rho_R, v_R, p_R) = (0.125, 0, 0.1) \). The diaphram is at \( \{x = -1\} \). </p>
<p><b>Equation of state:</b> van der Waals: \[ p(\rho, e) = (\gamma-1) \frac{\rho e + a\rho^2}{1 - b\rho} - a \rho^2 \] </p>
<p><b>Parameters</b>: \(\gamma = 1.4, a = 0.3215, b = 0.1\). </p>
