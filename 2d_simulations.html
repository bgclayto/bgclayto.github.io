<h3 style="font-size:150%">Two Tanks Problem</h3>
In this problem, we solve a Riemann-like problem where two square domains are connected by a small tube. 
The initial states begin at rest with high pressure and density in the left tank. 
The material passes through the tube and into the right tank.
We show a comparison between the van der Waals and ideal equations of state.
Simulation details are given below.

<h3 style="font-size:150%">Isentropic Vortex</h3>
<p>An analytic solution to the Euler equations can be derived by assuming the flow is isentropic (constant entropy) and divergence free (\(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v} = 0)\).
An ansantz solution is prescribed to the velocity and the derivation follows.
A detailed derivation can be found here: (<i>Put a link here</i>).

<p> 
The setup for this problem involves a shock moving with Mach ??? to the right which collides with a triangular obstacle. 
We follow the same setup given in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999115006300">Toro, Casto, Lee (2015)</a>. 
The problem is motivated from real physical experiments (CITE).

<p><b>Geometry:</b> \( \{(-0.65,0.5) \times (-0.5,0.5)\} \setminus K \) where \(K\) is the triangle formed by the vertices: \( (-0.2,0.0) \), \( (0.1, -1/6) \),  \( (0.1, 1/6) \). </p>
<p><b>Boundary Conditions:</b> The slip boundary condition (\(\boldsymbol{m} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} = 0 \)) is enforced on all sides. No boundary conditions were applied to the left or right sides. </p>

<h3 style="font-size:150%">Shock Diffraction on Backward Facing Corner</h3>
<p> This problem models a shock exiting a "tube".
Similar to the Shock Hitting Triangle problem, we start with an initial state and a Mach number and compute the state behind the shock using the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions.
As the shock leaves the tube, we observe the effect of diffraction around the corner.
The setup for this problem can greatly vary see CITE CITE CITE.
We follow the setup described in CITE.
